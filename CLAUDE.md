# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **datastar** project - currently a greenfield project with no established codebase. When working in this repository, you'll need to help establish the project structure and development workflows from scratch.

## Development Setup

**Note**: This project is in its initial state. The following sections should be updated as the project develops:

### Build & Development Commands
*To be established based on chosen technology stack*

Common patterns to look for once the project is initialized:
- `npm run dev` / `npm start` (Node.js projects)
- `cargo run` / `cargo build` (Rust projects)  
- `go run .` / `go build` (Go projects)
- `python -m pip install -e .` (Python projects)

### Testing Commands
*To be established based on testing framework*

### Linting & Formatting
*To be established based on tooling choices*

## Project Structure

Currently empty. Update this section as directories and modules are added.

## Architecture Notes

This project is starting from scratch. Key architectural decisions and patterns should be documented here as they emerge:

- **Technology Stack**: *To be determined*
- **Data Processing Approach**: *Given the "datastar" name, likely involves data handling*
- **Deployment Strategy**: *To be determined*

## Configuration

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Additional configuration files should be documented here as added

## Working with this Repository

Since this is a new project:

1. **Project Initialization**: Help establish the basic project structure based on user requirements
2. **Technology Selection**: Assist in choosing appropriate tools and frameworks
3. **Development Workflow**: Help set up build tools, testing, and CI/CD as needed
4. **Documentation**: Keep this CLAUDE.md file updated as the project evolves

## Important Notes

- This repository is not yet a git repository - initialize with `git init` if version control is needed
- No dependency management is currently set up - this should be established based on the chosen tech stack
- Update this file whenever significant architectural decisions or development workflows are established
